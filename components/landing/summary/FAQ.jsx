          IP geolocation are high-level location insights derived from an IP
          address. These generalized insights include the country, region,
          postal code, city, and latitude or longitude of the nearest city
          center.

        <Text>
          You can compare Internet Protocol to postal services in the
          real-world. A postal code is an identifier for mail routing. And, in
          very simple words, IP address is a digital postal code for internet
          traffic routing. Every device, website and network server have an IP
          address.

            There are 2 common standards for IP address: IPv4 (IP Version 4) and
            IPv6 (IP Version 6) that is aimed at replacing IPv4 in the future.

            uses 32 binary bits and contains from 4 to 12 digits, 4 numbers
            separated by dots.Examples: 8.8.4.4, 188.100.210.213

            uses 128 binary bits and can contain up to 45 characters (8 groups
            of 4 hexadecimal digits separated by 6 colons). Groups with all
            zeros can be shortened for the simplicity of the
            representation.Example: 2001:4860:4860::8888 (expanded â€“
            2001:4860:4860:0000:0000:0000:0000:8888)
