        "answer": "There are 2 common standards for IP address: IPv4 (IP Version 4) and IPv6 (IP Version 6) that is aimed at replacing IPv4 in the future. IPv4 address uses 32 binary bits and contains from 4 to 12 digits, 4 numbers separated by dots.Examples: 8.8.4.4, 188.100.210.213. IPv6 address uses 128 binary bits and can contain up to 45 characters (8 groups of 4 hexadecimal digits separated by 6 colons). Groups with all zeros can be shortened for the simplicity of the representation.Example: 2001:4860:4860::8888 (expanded – 2001:4860:4860:0000:0000:0000:0000:8888)"
